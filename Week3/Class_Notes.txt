	Container ?
	
		Containerization :::
		
			-> It is a process of packaging the application along with its dependencies
			
			
	Developers' / Deployment Perspective :::
	
		Role :
		
			Dev Environment :
			
				- Create Source Code 
				
				- Build 				--> mywebapp.war 
				
				Using Containerization :
				
				Package the application : (mywebapp.war,jdk_v11,Tomcat_v8)	==> mywebapp_img:v1.0
				
				
				Publish the Container Image to Container Registry(DockerHub/ACR)
				
			QA-Test Server :
			
			
				pull Container Image from Container Registry(DockerHub/ACR)
				
				Create Application Container 
	

			UAT-Test Server :
			
			
				pull Container Image from Container Registry(DockerHub/ACR)
				
				Create Application Container 


			Prod-Test Server :
			
			
				pull Container Image from Container Registry(DockerHub/ACR)
				
				Create Application Container 				
	
			
			
		Container Image :
		
			- It is static file that composed of various layers 
			- Non-Executable 
			- Dockerfile - composed of various Instructions to build an Image.
			
		Container :
		
			- Executable entity of Container Images 
			
			
		Terminologies :
		
			- Container Engine 			# To Create/Manage the Containers
			
			- Container Image 	
							- It is static file that composed of various layers 
							- Non-Executable 
							- Dockerfile - composed of various Instructions to build an Image.
							
			- Container
							- Executable entity of Container Images 

							
			- Container Registry 
							- Version Control / Maintain the Container Images 
							- (DockerHub/ACR)
							
			
			- Container Repository
			
							- Subset of Container Registry
							
							
							
			
			Version Control Source Code					==> 	Artifactory Libraries 			==> 	Container Registries
			
				- GitHub/AzRepos								- Jfrog/AzArtifact						- DockerHub/AzContainer Registry
				
					mywebapp.jsp_v1.1					==>		    mywebapp.war_v1.1			==> 	   mywebapp-Img_v1.1

				- docker 


Login to Linux Server :

- Elevate the access to root user.

- As a linux root, manage the packages!

- Linux Package Manager to install/uninstall/upgrade the Linux packages!

- The package managers are based on the Linux Distributions 

- The package managers are executed only as a root user by default


	Distributions 						Package Manager 
	
		- Debian/Ubuntu 					==> apt/apt-get 
	
		- centos/RHEL						==> yum 
	
		- Fedora							==> dnf

sudo apt install git -y			
git --version 

#Install Maven - Build Tool :
#https://maven.apache.org/install.html

sudo apt install maven -y

ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -b 521										#ubuntu 22.04 or higher version of ubuntu				


ls ~/.ssh 

#You should see following two files:

#id_ecdsa - private key
#id_ecdsa.pub - public


#cat id_rsa.pub > authorized_keys

cat id_ecdsa.pub > authorized_keys

chmod 600 /home/devopsadmin/.ssh/*


Maven --> Java Application Build Tool :

- Perform Java maven Application Build (Compile,Test,Create Artifacts)

- Pre-requisites :

	- POM.XML File 				#	Should be maintained in the Source Code Repository by the Developers!
								# 	It is used to define the properties of maven application build 
								#	It is used to define all the dependencies and plugins required to build the maven applications.
								
								
	- Maven Goals :
	
		- Compile 				# 	mvn compile - Compile the Source Code and produce the compilation results
		- Test 					# 	mvn test 	- To Perform: Compile and Unit Test. 
		- Create Artifacts 		# 	mvn package - To Perform: Compile, Unit Test and Package(Create Artifacts)
		
		
		- The Packages by default gets created in the target/ folder of the project workspace!
		
					target/*.war			# out come of application build!

To Deploy any Micro-Service Based Application Services 

	- Docker 
	
	- Kubernetes 
	
	Working Docker :::
	
		- Access to Contiainer Registry 
		
		- Using Docker Cli Commands 
		
			- To Access Container Images from Container Registries(DockerHub/AzCR)
			
			- To Create Container Images based on the Application Artifacts and dependencies
			
			- To Execute/Run the Containers based on the Container Images 
			
			- To Publish the Container Images to Container Registries(DockerHub/AzCR)
			
		
			- Login to the running Containers 
			
			- Capture the Container Execution Logs
			
			- Share the Container Logs with the Application teams 


	Install Docker Engine in the Build Server:
		
		- sudo -i 
		
		- apt install docker.io -y
		
	
	Docker Cli Commands :
	
		
		- docker images 				# To get the list of docker images in the local machine 

		- docker ps 					# To get the list of all active docker containers 
		
		- docker ps -a 					# To get the list of all active/inactive docker containers 
		
		

Next :

	- Work with Docker Cli Commands

	- Work with Docker Cli Commands ::
	
	- Working with Container Registries :
	
		- DockerHub 
		
		- Azure Container Registry


	usermod -aG docker devopsadmin
	
	
	Docker Cli Commands :
	
		- docker images 					# To get the list of docker images in the local machine 

		- docker ps 						# To get the list of all active docker containers 
		
		- docker ps -a 						# To get the list of all active/inactive docker containers 
		
		- docker pull <Container_Image>		# Download latest version an Image from Container Registry 

		- docker pull alpine:3.22.1			# Download specific version of an Image from Container Registry 
		
		- docker run <Container_Image>		# To Create and run the Container based on the Container Image
		
		
		- Three Modes of Container Execution :
		
			- Foreground/Attached Mode 	:											# Default
			
				- It executed in active Terminal 
				
				Eg.: 
				
					docker run ubuntu sleep 20 				
			
			- Background/Detached Mode :
			
				Eg.: 
				
					docker run -d ubuntu sleep 20 					
			
			- Interactive Mode :
			
				Eg.: 
		
					- docker run -it ubuntu bash
					
					- exit 						# Exit Container running in interactive mode 
		
		
			- Start a Container :
			
					- docker start <container_id>
		
			- Login to running Contianer ::
			
					- docker exec -it <Container_ID> bash
				
					- docker exec -it ffdcc671fb70 bash
					
					- exit 						# Logoff
					
			- Stop a Container :
			
					- docker stop <container_id>	
					
			- kill Container 
			
					- docker kill <container_id>
					
					
			- Delete Container / Image ::
			
			
				docker rmi <image_id> 				# Remove/Delete Container Image from Local Machine
				
				docker rm <container_id>			# Remove/Delete Container from Local Machine


		Port Mapping!
		
			==> Is used to map the Container Port with the Host Port 
			
					-p host_port:container_port
			
					docker run -it -p 8085:8080 tomcat:8.0				
					
					docker run -it -p 8086:80 nginx:latest
